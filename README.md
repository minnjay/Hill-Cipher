# Hill-Cipher

The Hill Class is a class that has Encryption key (Matrix E) and Decryption key (Matrix D). It uses encryption key to encrypt a plaintext to a ciphertext and uses decryption key to decrypt a ciphertext to a plain text.

The Hill Class has 2 Matrix (E and D). Therefore, a Matrix class is implemented in this project. 
The Matrix class is a class that is a data structure that mimics the behaviors of a matrix. It  has fucntions that can perform the operations a matrix can do.
